    <h3> Introduction </h3>

  
    <p> 
        I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate with a concentration 
        in developmental science at the Psychology and Brain 
        Sciences Department, Boston University, USA. I work on 
        cognitive development in 2-12-year children. My Ph.D. 
        thesis is on the role of topological properties in the 
        development of perception, attention, working memory, 
        and object categorization. In my future research, I plan 
        to work on how adversity impact 
        the brain and cognitive development in international 
        populations (primarily in developing countries). On 
        another side of the same coin, I would like to investigate
        how children in developing countries conceptualize
        inequality, status hierarchies, blatant discrimination,
        and dehumanization.
