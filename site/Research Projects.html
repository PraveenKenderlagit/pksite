            My dissertation broadly investigates the role of topology in perception, working memory, 
            and categorization in children. Topology is imagined as a “rubber-sheet geometry” in 
            which the number of holes, connectivity, and inside/outside relationship of an object 
            remain invariant through deformations like stretching, twisting, bending, and shrinking, 
            except through gluing and tearing (see detailed review by Chen, 2005). Unlike surface 
            features (e.g., shape, color) topological properties (like holes in objects) provides 
            stability to the visual representations across different contexts.

    <h3> Development of Perception of hole shapes </h3>
    <section class="pew">
        <div> 
            <p  class="box2 intro">
                Holes act as a paradox in figure/ground organization (Palmer, 1999). Holes are massless object 
                space but we still perceive and report the shape of holes. Kim (2020) using Bouba/Kiki phonetic 
                sound and shape associations showed that adults can phenomenologically perceive the shape of holes. 
                In this study, in collaboration with Dr. Melissa M Kibbe and Dr. Sung-Ho Kim, I am investigating a 
                developmental pattern of phenomenological perception of hole shapes in 3-7-year-old children by 
                exploiting the shape-sound correspondence of Bouba/Kiki. We presented the flower-shaped hole and 
                spikier shape hole object and asked the children "Which one is Bouba/Kiki?". In experiment 1, we 
                found that direct perception of hole shape develops between 3-7-years suggesting that children can 
                assign the inner contour to the hole and therefore perceive the hole shape. We are currently collecting 
                data for experiment 2 (control for experiment 1) and experiment 3 (functional meaning of holes by adding eyes).

    <h3> Role of Topological Properties in Toddler's Object Representations </h3>
    <section>    
        <div >
            <p>    
                Previous research has extensively studied working memory development for surface features in infancy 
                and middle and late childhood but there is a lack of research on how toddlers represent surface and 
                topological properties in working memory. A recent study by Applin and Kibbe (under review) showed that 
                there is a development of working memory performance for colors between 24-40-month-old toddlers. However, 
                except for one study by Kibbe and Leslie (2016) which showed that 6-month-old infants can maintain a single 
                topological property, there are no studies that compared how children represent surface and topological 
                properties in working memory and whether and how do these object representations change between 24-40-month-old 
                infants. In this study, we plan to investigate how topological properties are maintained in working memory 
                compared to surface features in toddlers (24-40-month-olds). Furthermore, we are investigating how selective 
                attention influences the representation of topological properties and surface features in working memory in 
                24-40-month-old toddlers.

    <h3> Topology in Object Categorization </h3>
    <section class="box2">
           <div>
            <p class="rpwriteup">
                Children extend novels labels (count nouns) of novel objects to the test objects that are similar in shape. 
                This phenomenon called shape-bias is consistently observed in previous research and it has been shown that 
                shape can act as a cue to category membership. However, metric shape like other surface features does not provide 
                invariance to object representations across different contexts given surface features change based on the movement 
                of an object or the observer. Unlike surface features, topological properties provide invariance to object 
                representations and therefore provide stability to object representations. In this study, in collaboration with 
                Dr. Melissa M Kibbe and Dr. Sung-Ho Kim, I am investigating whether topological properties (presence of a hole in 
                an object) compete with the shape when children extend the novel count nouns of novel objects to the test objects 
                (experiment 1). We found that topology and shape compete when children extend labels. In Experiment 2, we tested 
                whether equating topology and changing figure and ground relations between the test stimuli of Experiment 1 change 
                children's preference to shape bias. In Experiment 3, we tested whether children show topological bias over color 
                when they extend labels to other objects and found that topology and color compete when children extend labels to 
                other objects. These study results suggest that topology is automatically encoded whenever the object representations 
                are processed and they might inform about categories at the super-ordinate level, unlike surface features which are 
                crucial for categorizing basic categories.

    <h3> Interaction between Working Memory and Exploration in Complex Task </h3>
    <section class="box2">
 
        <div>
            <p class="rpwriteup">
                In this project, in collaboration with Dr. Melissa M Kibbe, I explored how children strategically use working memory and 
                motor exploration in a cognitively demanding complex task. Children played a category search task in which 9 objects are 
                presented on the screen and children should match three objects that satisfy the rule. We varied the cognitive demands of 
                the task by increasing the complexity of the rules and exploration demands by increasing the time to view the objects after 
                clicking on them. For example, children are asked to match three objects that share one feature, share two features, and 
                share one feature and are different on one feature. We measured children's search rates by computing the total number of 
                objects they visited, the number of objects they revisited, and the number of objects they visited in between revisiting 
                the same object (a proxy for maintaining information in working memory) for each rule. We found that children's exploration 
                rates increased with an increase in working memory load or complexity of the rules. Children strategically shifted to maintaining 
                more information in working memory when the exploration cost was higher. These results suggest that children can strategically 
                shift between relying on working memory and exploration based on the cognitive demands of the task.

    <h3> Persistence of visual working memory representations in long-term memory </h3>
    <section class="box2">
        <div>
            <p class="rpwriteup">
                Previous research has shown that briefly presented objects in a working memory task are represented in long-term memory and 
                stimuli in the working memory task are hierarchically encoded with different levels of accuracy. In this project, in collaboration 
                with Dr. Melissa M Kibbe, I am investigating whether adults represent a configuration of colors briefly presented during a change 
                detection task in their long-term memory. To test this, we combined the standard color change detection task and long-term recognition 
                task. Participants first reported the presence or absence of the probe color in a change detection task. Interspersed between the 6-10 
                trial blocks of the change detection task, the configuration of colors was presented (referred to as set-recall trials) and participants 
                reported whether they saw the same configuration of colors in earlier trials of the change detection task or not. We computed the accuracy 
                for the change detection task and on set-recall trials (long-term memory trials). We manipulated the set size of the change detection task 
                to measure the effect of persistence of configuration in long-term memory. We found that participants reported higher accuracy than chance 
                on set-recall trials suggesting that brief presentation of stimuli during visual working memory tasks is hierarchically encoded (i.e., 
                configuration and individual colors). Furthermore, the accuracy on the working memory task predicted the accuracy on the set-recall trial 
                indicating the items that are encoded and maintained in working memory has a higher probability to persist in long-term memory. Finally, 
                we found the set size of the working memory task did not have any effect on long-term memory performance. Currently, we are testing the 
                long-term memory for the configuration of real-world objects
